# Purchase Behavior Modeling by Age

This project was developed as part of an MSc in Data Science assignment for the **Mathematics for Data Science** module. It explores how age influences consumer purchasing behavior using both weighted and unweighted probability models.

## ðŸ“Š Overview

The goal of this project is to simulate and analyze how different age demographics impact purchase likelihood. It compares:
- A **weighted model**, where purchase probability increases with age
- An **unweighted model**, where all age groups have the same purchase probability

The results demonstrate how realistic weightings can drastically affect insights in marketing and analytics.

## ðŸ§  Key Objectives
- Simulate purchase behavior across multiple age groups
- Use Python to apply probability theory and conditional probability
- Compare manual and automated model outputs
- Critically evaluate the implications of each modeling approach

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib,Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Probability Theory (Bayes, Conditional Probability)
- Academic Framework: Ross (2014), Wasserman (2004)

## ðŸ“ˆ Sample Output
- Weighted model shows ~80% purchase probability for 70-year-olds
- Unweighted model yields ~20% across all ages
- Visualizations highlight stark differences in outcomes
